# AWS Glue ETL Job Table Creation Documentation

## Overview

This Python code represents an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) job designed to process and load data from a CSV file in an S3 bucket into Amazon Redshift. It performs data transformation, dynamic table creation, and batch data insertion. Below, we break down the key components and their functionalities.

## Input

- **S3 Bucket with CSV Data**: The code expects to find a CSV file in an S3 bucket. This CSV file contains the data that you want to analyze and load into Amazon Redshift.

## Code Components and Functions

### Logging Configuration

The code sets up logging to track the execution and debugging of the ETL process.

### Redshift Connection Parameters (`redshift_params`)

This dictionary contains the connection details for your Amazon Redshift cluster, including the host, port, database name, username, and password.

### S3 Data Retrieval

The code uses the `boto3` library to access the specified S3 bucket and retrieve the CSV data. It loads this data into a Pandas DataFrame (`df`) for further processing.

### Data Transformation and Mapping (`city_to_country`)

The code creates a dictionary to map city names to countries. It performs transformations on the data, including counting mentions of cities in text.

### Dynamic Table Creation

The code dynamically generates SQL commands to create Redshift tables based on a predefined schema. The schema includes columns for city, country, and monthly mention counts.

### Batch Data Insertion

The transformed data is inserted into Redshift tables in batches. The batch size can be adjusted based on your requirements.

## Output

- **Amazon Redshift Tables**: The primary output consists of Amazon Redshift tables containing the transformed data. These tables are structured according to the schema defined in the code, with columns representing cities, countries, and monthly mention counts.

The purpose of this ETL code is to take raw CSV data, process and transform it, and then load the results into Amazon Redshift tables. These Redshift tables can then be used for various analytics and reporting purposes.

In summary, the code reads data from an S3 bucket, processes it to count mentions of cities, maps city names to countries, creates Redshift tables, and inserts the transformed data into these tables. The Redshift tables are the primary output of this ETL process and can be used for further analysis.
